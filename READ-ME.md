### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learnt
I learnt how to set a background that has a container inside it using the width, height, display, position and many more properties.
Code snippets of mostly what i learnt below:

```html
    <div>
        <h2 id="plan">Annual Plan</h2>
        <p class="price">$59.99/year</p>
    </div>
```
```css
body{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    position: absolute;
    background-image: url("../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    opacity: 0.9;
}

.container{
    margin: 50px auto;
    max-width: 450px;
    width: 100%;
    display: block;
    font-family: Red Hat Display, sans-serif;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, i will be focusing more on learning CSS to the fullest and learning to build more responsive projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.google.com) - This helped me with building the project as i asked questions based on my little knowledge of HTML and CSS , i tell you today that google is your friend, use it, it works.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
